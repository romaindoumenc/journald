Heck yeah, we want to compress long strings that can for example be large queries sent to the database. To do so, we use the snappy library, that should provide a reasonably fast implementation of a compression for relatively good performance. Another level of compression is of course the record de-duplication offered by the way this database is modelled. Interestingly, the code in the debug.go file generate a wonderfull graphviz-compatible dot file, very usefull for visual debugging. I have no clue how this approach will scale, though, since graphs are notoriously bad when many elements are present â€” they are called spaghetti chart for a reason :)")
